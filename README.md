# Interactive Narrator
**Developed @ Utrecht University**

Visualize your user stories to improve understanding of the project, inspect system functionality 
and improve communication among stakeholders.

Please visit [this page](http://interactivenarrator.science.uu.nl) to start using the application.

This application uses the Visual Narrator (https://github.com/marcelrobeer/visualnarrator) to generate a conceptual model which is then
visualized using Vis.js and is presented to the user in the browser from where the visualization can be adapted to cater to the 
user's needs.
